    Utility-weighted mRS
    --------------------

    In addition to mRS we may calculate utility-weighted mRS. Utility is an
    estimated quality of life (0=dead, 1=full quality of life, negative numbers
    indicate a 'worse than death' outcome).

    If not given explicitly, the following mRS utility scores are used.
    mRS Utility scores are based on a pooled Analysis of 20 000+ Patients. From
    Wang X, Moullaali TJ, Li Q, Berge E, Robinson TG, Lindley R, et al.
    Utility-Weighted Modified Rankin Scale Scores for the Assessment of Stroke
    Outcome. Stroke. 2020 Aug 1;51(8):2411-7.

    | mRS Score | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5     | 6    |
    |-----------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|------|
    | Utility   | 0.97 | 0.88 | 0.74 | 0.55 | 0.20 | -0.19 | 0.00 |

    General methodology
    -------------------

    The model assumes that log odds of mRS <= x declines uniformally with time.
    The imported distribution give mRS <= x probabilities at t=0 (time of
    stroke onset) and time of no effect. These two distributions are converted
    to log odds and weighted according to the fraction of time, in relation to
    when the treatment no longer has an effect, that has passed. The weighted
    log odds distribution is converted back to probability of mRS <= x. mRS
    are also converted to a utility-weighted mRS.

    If not given explicitly, the time to no-effect is taken as:
    1) 6.3 hours for IVT
      (from Emberson et al, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60584-5.)
    2) 8 hours for MT
      (from Fransen et al; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.3886.
      this analysis did not include late-presenting patients selected by
      advanced imaging).

    The shift in mRS for each patient
    between not_treated and treated distribution is calculated. A negative
    shift is indicative of improvement (lower mRS disability score).


    Usage:
    ------
    Update the arrays of patient details in the trial dictionary.
    Each will run the sanity checks in the Evaluated_array class
    and display an error message if invalid data is passed in.
    Then run the main calculate_outcomes() function.
    Example:
        # Initiate the object:
        discrete_outcome = Discrete_outcome(mrs_dists={pandas dataframe})
        # Import patient data:
        discrete_outcome.trial['onset_to_needle_mins'].data = {array 1}
        discrete_outcome.trial['ivt_chosen_bool'].data = {array 2}
        discrete_outcome.trial['stroke_type_code'].data = {array 3}
        discrete_outcome.trial['mrs_pre_stroke'].data = {array 3}
        # Calculate outcomes:
        results_by_stroke_type, full_cohort_outcomes = (
            discrete_outcome.calculate_outcomes())


    Limitations and notes:
    ----------------------
    When fixed probabilities are not provided, they are generated
    using np.random.uniform. This random element means that running the
    same data twice will produce different results.

    For MT, there are only mRS probability distributions for patients with
    LVOs. If a patient with an nLVO is treated with MT, the patient details
    are quietly updated to reassign them as LVO and so use the base LVO
    mRS distributions for pre-stroke, no-treatment, and no-effect.

    Some patients receive both IVT and MT. Separate outcomes are calculated
    for each case and stored in the LVO+IVT and LVO+MT arrays. However in the
    combined full cohort outcomes, only one of the sets of outcomes can be
    used. The chosen set is the one with the better improvement in outcomes.
    The separate LVO+IVT and LVO+MT arrays are then *not* updated to remove
    the rejected set of outcomes, so any mean shifts in values across the
    LVO+IVT group (for example) will include data that was not actually used
    in the combined full cohort outcomes.

    Internally, stroke types are referred to by a number rather than their
    full name. The codes are:
      0 - "other" stroke type
      1 - nLVO
      2 - LVO
